SQL Operators: Explained
SQL operators are used in queries to perform operations on data. They are categorized into different types based on their functionality.

1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Used for performing mathematical calculations.

Operator	            Description	                Example
+	Addition	        SELECT 10 + 5;              → 15
-	Subtraction	        SELECT 10 - 5;              → 5
*	Multiplication	    SELECT 10 * 5;              → 50
/	Division	        SELECT 10 / 5;              → 2
%	Modulus (Remainder)	SELECT 10 % 3;               → 1


2️⃣ Comparison Operators
Used for comparing values in WHERE conditions.

Operator	                Description	                                Example
=	                        Equal to	                                SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age = 30;
!= or <>	                Not equal to	                            SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age <> 30;
>	                        Greater than	                            SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
<	                        Less than	                                SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age < 25;
>=	                        Greater than or equal to	                SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age >= 40;
<=	                        Less than or equal to	                    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age <= 50;


3️⃣ Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause.

Operator	                        Description	                                Example
AND	                                Both conditions must be true	            SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 25 AND salary > 50000;
OR	                                At least one condition must be true	        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age < 25 OR salary > 50000;
NOT	                                Negates a condition	                        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT age = 30;


4️⃣ Bitwise Operators
Used to perform bit-level operations (mostly in SQL Server & MySQL).

Operator	                        Description	                                Example
&	                                Bitwise AND	SELECT 5 & 3;                    → 1
`	                                `	                                         Bitwise OR
^	                                Bitwise XOR	SELECT 5 ^ 3;                    → 6
~	                                Bitwise NOT	SELECT                           ~5;


5️⃣ Special Operators
Used for filtering data in queries.

Operator	                        Description	                                    Example
BETWEEN	                            Checks if a value is within a range         	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 40;
IN	                                Checks if a value is in a given list	        SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age IN (25, 30, 35);
LIKE	                            Pattern matching using wildcards (% and _)	    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%'; (Names starting with A)
IS NULL	                            Checks if a value is NULL	                    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;


6️⃣ Wildcards (Used with LIKE)
Wildcard	                        Description	                                    Example
%	                                Matches zero or more characters	                LIKE 'A%' (Names starting with 'A')
_	                                Matches exactly one character	                LIKE '_a%' (Second letter is 'a')
